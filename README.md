## Project Overview

This e-commerce website was developed as part of my internship at **`DeveloperHub Carporation`** from **Nov, 2025**. The project was completed over a period of **3 weeks** and demonstrates a complete front-end implementation of an online shopping / E-Commerce platform.

### What This Project About

This web application simulates a real-world e-commerce platform where users can browse products, search for specific items, view detailed product information, add items to their shopping cart and navigate through various pages including About Us, Contact, Help Center, Store Locator and Shipping Information. The entire project is built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript without any frameworks, showcasing fundamental web development skills and best practices.

### Internship Task Requirements

The internship assignment required the development of a functional e-commerce website with the following specifications:

- **Week 1:** Project planning, wireframing, and basic HTML structure for all pages
- **Week 2:** CSS styling implementation, responsive design, and navigation system
- **Week 3:** JavaScript functionality for product display, search, and cart management
- **Week 4:** Integration, testing, bug fixes, and final deployment

### Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were to:

- Create a fully functional front-end e-commerce platform
- Implement responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop devices
- Develop interactive features using vanilla JavaScript
- Ensure clean, maintainable and well-documented code
- Follow modern web development best practices
- Deliver a professional user interface with smooth user experience

### User Interface Overview

The website features a modern, clean design with intuitive navigation. The color scheme uses a purple gradient theme (#667eea to #764ba2) for primary elements, maintaining consistency across all pages. The interface includes a persistent navigation bar, search functionality, shopping cart icon, language selector, and user authentication buttons. Each page is designed with accessibility and usability in mind, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.
